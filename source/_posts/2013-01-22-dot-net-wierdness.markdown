Argh.  Every time I use a Microsoft programming tool or library, I am first
initially amazed at how slick it is and how it solves 90% of my problems for
me.  The problem is that the other 10% is so hidden away and obscure that it is
actually harder to use if they just decided not to hide the underlying
functionality.

Maybe the documentation for the StringDictionary Collection is just not
telling what I want to hear, or maybe I'm not understanding it.  I can't
tell whether there are any actual accessors for the keys and values other than iterating through the list.

Sigh.  I'm just whining because dictionaries in .Net aren't first class data
citizens like in python or ruby.  More work tomorrow.
