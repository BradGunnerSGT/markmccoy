In case you aren't following my band Road Home on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/roadhomeband),
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/roadh), or our
[website](http://roadhomeband.net/) (you should be!), we are having a CD
Release party for our first CD on April 19th.  I am super stoked about this.  I
submitted the final project to the printer yesterday and we should have the
discs in hand next week (but you can't get one until the 19th!!).  The album
should also be available in the iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play music stores,
and also Spotify and a few other online streaming sites. 

The CD Release Party will be at a pretty cool dive bar that is right up the
road in Comfort, Texas (about 20 minutes up IH-10 from UTSA) called the Cocky
Rooster.  We've played there a couple of times last year and had a blast.  [Details here](http://roadhomeband.net/gigs)

Come on out to enjoy the fun, have a few drinks, and listen to some rocking Texas Country.
