Ubuntu has a project that they call their "One Hundred Paper Cuts", where
people list the little minor annoyances that detract them from truly enjoying
using Ubuntu.  You know, the little rough edges that annoy you for about two
seconds every time you rub against them.  Add that up and 2 seconds a day for
days or weeks or years can get you quite annoyed.  Interested developers or
uses can then go in and tackle these paper cuts to smooth out the tiny rough
edges.  I think other large projects could follow this model.

Today I rubbed up against one of these paper cuts in one of my least favorite
tools ever: Microsoft Active Directory Users and Computers.  I have to use this tool on a
daily basis and this paper cut gets me ever damn time: when you click on the
"search" button and the search dialog pops up, the focus is not on the "Name"
field (the first text entry field) but on the "Find Now" button.

<!-- more -->

The most common use case for this dialog box is to search for a user's account.
Why put the focus on the "Find Now" button?  All this does is add one extra
mouse click to the workflow.  "One extra mouse click, what are you worried
about that for? You must be on crack.", you might say.  Well, I have to say that
extra mouse click multiple times a day really adds up.

*Every time* I need to use this tool, my mind is intent on getting the search
dialog up and entering the user's id or name to find them and work on their
account.  Every time I click the search button, my hand goes back from the
mouse to the keyboard and I start typing, and every time I have to take my hand
off the keyboard, back to the mouse, and click in the "Name" field.

It seems trivial to someone else, but this little paper cut gets me several
times a day, every day, for years now.  Maybe once we upgrade to a newer
version of Active Directory the ADUC tool will have this bug fixed.  I can't
understand how it got there in the first place.

Developers!  Use your own products and note the little things that annoy you
about them.  This will only help your end users in the long run.
