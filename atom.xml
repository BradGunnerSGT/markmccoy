    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a great show on Friday night at the oddly named &#8220;Cocky Rooster&#8221; bar in
Comfort, TX.  This is a pretty cool little hole-in-the-wall bar with some
really laid back and fun people.  There were some regulars that remembered us
from last time so that was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I have to say, I haven&#8217;t even picked up a pair of sticks since the last gig and
I was surprised at how well I played.  Everthing just seemed to flow out of me
and I felt that I sounded better than I have in a while.  Sometimes you just need
a break to get the juices flowing again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, my migration from Ubuntu to Fedora on my workstation at work went
pretty smoothly.  There were a few hiccups (like my SATA to USB dock
decided to act up at one point and I had to wait until I scrounged up
another internal SATA cable to plug the old drive into the motherboard)
and Fedora had some strangeness at first, but after a <code>yum
upgrade</code> or two everything was a-ok.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The main bit of install-time strangeness was that I had to edit the
<code>/etc/sysconfig/network</code> file by hand to set my static IP
instead of DHCP. The network manager utility tried to load into the system tray
the first time I logged in, but it wouldn&#8217;t come up at first (the error message
said that it wasn&#8217;t compatible with this version of Fedora any more??), but the
next day after a <code>yum upgrade</code>it popped up in the system tray at the
top where it was supposed to be.  That was pretty weird.</p>

<p>I must say, I am liking Gnome 3 very much.  I got used to some of the Unity
keybindings but the Gnome 3 ones match exactly how I work.  I use a 2 monitor
configuration and I keep a Byobu terminal open on one screen at all times,
which is exactly how Gnome 3 does it.  I also prefer to have a single row of
virtual screens instead of the 2x2 grid.  I rarely used the virtual screen
feature of Unity until recently, but the Gnome 3 layout makes way more sense.</p>

<p>Canonical has done a great job with Unity, but Gnome 3 seems to fit my workflow
a lot better.  I also didn&#8217;t like how with the latest version of Ubuntu, the
Unity menu would take forever to come up.  Fedora with Gnome 3 feels so much
snappier on the same hardware.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Argh.  Every time I use a Microsoft programming tool or library, I am first
initially amazed at how slick it is and how it solves 90% of my problems for
me.  The problem is that the other 10% is so hidden away and obscure that it is
actually harder to use if they just decided not to hide the underlying
functionality.</p>

<p>Maybe the documentation for the StringDictionary Collection is just not
telling what I want to hear, or maybe I&#8217;m not understanding it.  I can&#8217;t
tell whether there are any actual accessors for the keys and values other than iterating through the list.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I&#8217;m just whining because dictionaries in .Net aren&#8217;t first class data
citizens like in python or ruby.  More work tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By the way, if you search Google for my name, you might find markmccoy.com (not
linking it, you can go there if you want but I don&#8217;t recommend it).  <strong>That is
not me.</strong>  That guy is a crazy conspiracy theorist and probably my exact
opposite.  Maybe he&#8217;s a doppelganger who has a goatee (Evil Me).</p>
