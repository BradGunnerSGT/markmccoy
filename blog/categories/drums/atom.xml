    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a great show on Friday night at the oddly named "Cocky Rooster" bar in
Comfort, TX.  This is a pretty cool little hole-in-the-wall bar with some
really laid back and fun people.  There were some regulars that remembered us
from last time so that was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I have to say, I haven't even picked up a pair of sticks since the last gig and
I was surprised at how well I played.  Everthing just seemed to flow out of me
and I felt that I sounded better than I have in a while.  Sometimes you just need
a break to get the juices flowing again.</p>
